I'm thinking of what functions each class needs to have, and what should be donefd in each function.
A lot of this stuff may have already been said in Adam's file about character classes, but I'm Just writing down my thoughts to get a general idea
on how I should go about implementing this.

First of all, we'll need a function to make a character.  It should let the player choose their job class, name, etc.  Additionally,
they should be able to randomize their class (and I guess we could think of some random funny names or something if we want names to be randomized too...).

Character
-Move-
Just use the wmove from the curses library, so the job classes could just inherit from it.  
For enemies, we could generate a random number (1-4) to determine direction of movement instead of using arrow keys.


-Attack-
Take in a character as a parameter. Attacker's strength - other character's defense = damage dealt maybe?
This should be the same for all classes,player and enemies. Class-specific attacks would be different of course.


-Reduce HP-
Takes in an integer for damage.  Would calculate currentHP = currentHP - damage.


-Increase HP-
This would be used when using a healing spell or a potion.  Takes in an integer parameter for amount to heal.  Current HP = Current HP + amountToHeal.



If complications arise when using inheritance, we could always just not use it.  These classes should still be simple enough to implement, 
even without polymorphism and inheritance.

Will add more later. Just edit this if you want to leave some feedback.
