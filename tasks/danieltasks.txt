Update on progress:
I have made a list of 3 jobs we could use.

1.Warrior - High attack but cannot heal. 
   Stats: High attack/ High Defense/ High HP 

2.Healer - Very low attack, but can heal himself.  
Each heal would take some of points of his magic gauge away.  
If he has 0 magic points, he can't heal.
   Stats: Low Attack/ Low Defense/ Low HP

3.Paladin - A mix of warrior and healer.
Does less damage than warrior but more than mage.  Heals less than 
mage and has less MP.  I picked this, because it would let us 
reuse stuff from the other two very easily.
   Stats: Decent Attack/ Decent Defense/ Decent HP


Suggestion for your next task:
Think of ways to implement these jobs into the project, using 
inheritance, polymorphism, etc.  Make outlines of functions for
each job.
