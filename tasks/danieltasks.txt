Update on progress:
I have made a list of 3 jobs we could use.

1.Warrior - High attack but cannot heal. 
   Stats: High attack/ High Defense/ High HP 

2.Healer - Very low attack, but can heal himself.  
Each heal would take some of points of his magic gauge away.  
If he has 0 magic points, he can't heal.
   Stats: Low Attack/ Low Defense/ Low HP

3.Paladin - A mix of warrior and healer.
Does less damage than warrior but more than mage.  Heals less than 
mage and has less MP.  I picked this, because it would let us 
reuse stuff from the other two very easily.
   Stats: Decent Attack/ Decent Defense/ Decent HP


Suggestion for your next task:
Think of ways to implement these jobs into the project, using 
inheritance, polymorphism, etc.  Make outlines of functions for
each job.

Great job, work closely with Adam on this since you guys will overlap in design. Our first milestone for the project as a whole is to get a character generated, get a map loaded, and be able to move the character. Keep that in mind when initial design takes place.
